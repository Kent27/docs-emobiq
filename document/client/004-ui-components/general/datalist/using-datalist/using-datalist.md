# Dynamic Replication and Customized Layouts with Datalist Component

The **Datalist** component in eMOBIQ comes with a unique behaviour that affects child components â€“ it dynamically replicates child components for each record within a given array or data source. This dynamic replication feature empowers our users to craft personalized layouts for every individual record, adding a layer of customization that enhances the overall data presentation.

## Unleashing Creativity: Tailored Layouts for Each Record

With the **Datalist** component, the possibilities for data presentation are endless. Users have the freedom to design distinct layouts for different records, tailoring the arrangement and styling of components to suit their specific needs. This flexibility allows for a more engaging and user-friendly display of information. For instance, if your dataset contains a list of products, each product's unique attributes can be showcased through dedicated child components, making the information more relevant and impactful.

## Intelligent Component Identification

In this dynamic environment where components are replicated at runtime, traditional fixed variable names won't cut it for component identification. This is where the power of the **Datalist** component's identification mechanism comes into play.

Components within the replicated records are identified using a combination of the **ID Prefix** and the **ID Field**. The **ID Prefix** serves as a constant prefix value that ensures component uniqueness. The real magic lies in the **ID Field**, which is a value that is unique for each record. Typically, this would be an identification number or code associated with the record itself.

By combining the **ID Prefix** and the **ID Field**, our platform ensures that each replicated component within a record has a distinct identifier. This intelligent identification strategy facilitates seamless interaction and manipulation of individual components within the **Datalist** records.

In a nutshell, the **Datalist** component's dynamic replication and ingenious identification mechanism grant our users the ability to fashion tailor-made layouts for each record in their dataset. This groundbreaking functionality opens up a world of opportunities for innovative and diverse data representation.
