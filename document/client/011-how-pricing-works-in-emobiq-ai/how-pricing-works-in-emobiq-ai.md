# How Pricing Works in eMOBIQ AI

## Introduction

Setting a budget is a crucial step in managing your project effectively. Below, we provide a clear breakdown of how pricing works, so you can make informed decisions.

## Understanding the Pricing Model

Our pricing structure is designed to be transparent and flexible. The cost of your project is primarily determined by two key factors:

- **Application Size (Number of Pages)**: The complexity and scope of your application impact the number of pages required. If a specific page count isnâ€™t provided in the prompt, it will be automatically determined by AI.

Remember, not all allocated budget here will be used in one go. It adjusts based on your application size, ensuring efficient resource management.

## Defining Your Application Size

Before submission, you can specify the estimated size of your application in the prompt:

- **Small**: 3-5 pages
- **Medium**: 8-10 pages
- **Large**: 12-15 pages

The final size may vary depending on the number of features and complexity outlined in your prompt.

## Choosing AI Engine

- **Swiftly**: Up to **2** revisions for a streamlined process.

## Estimated Cost Breakdown

| **Number of Pages** | **Revision Mode** | **Estimated Cost** |
|:-------------------:|:-----------------:|:------------------:|
| 3-5 | $20 |
| 8-10 | $50 |
| 12-15 | $80 |
