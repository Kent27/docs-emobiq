I want to create a documentation for my no-code platform, called eMOBIQ.
This section is called global functions.
Global Functions in eMOBIQ allow users to create and manage their own custom functions that can be reused across multiple pages and components. Global functions are user-defined logic blocks built with other logic blocks in emobiq. These functions can be used in the visual logic and provide a convenient and efficient way to add event-driven logic based on specified requirements.

To create a global function, users can access the "Global Functions" section and add a new global function. By selecting the new global function, the global function inspector should display configuations for result and parameters. The selected function's implementation is displayed on the visual logic interface, where users can easily edit and customize the function according to their needs. In the inspector, 'Parameters' specify the parameters that the function will take as inputs when you call it in the visual logic. 'Result' specifies the global variable name that represent the result of the function. To return any values from the global function, assign the desired output value to the result global variable. If there is no result global variable name defined, then the return value from a global function will be 'false' by default.

To use retrieve the return value of global functions, you can do so by using using a 'getVar' function on the global variable name associated with the global function result. Alternatively, can also use global function as a subflow of another function and get the reesul directly as an input value to the caller function.
