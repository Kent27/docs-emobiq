## Introduction to Plugins

eMOBIQ allows you to import custom components and actions through plugins. This advanced feature empowers you to extend your app's capabilities.

Plugins are modular pieces of code that enhance the functionality of the eMOBIQ. They can be developed by eMOBIQ or third-party developers and serve as building blocks to add features, integrations, and custom logic to your applications.

## Getting Started with Plugins

1. Go to [eMOBIQ Platform](https://app.emobiq.com/) and select an application where we will use the plugin.
2. Go to the global configuration page, then click the plugins tab.
3. Search and select the plugin package to be included in the project.
4. The plugin package is now added, check the actions/components in your project.

## Create Your Own Plugin
You can also create and import your own custom plugins to be used within your own project. For more information, refer to [service manager](../2-9-2-service-manager/service-manager.md) section.
