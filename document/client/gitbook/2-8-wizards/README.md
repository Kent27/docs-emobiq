# Wizards

Wizards are intuitive tools within eMOBIQ that simplify complex processes by providing step-by-step guidance. They enable users to accomplish specific tasks and configure various aspects of their mobile app without extensive coding knowledge.

Wizards, such as the Page Wizard and Function Wizard, streamline the creation of pages and configuration of logic. They break down tasks into manageable steps, offering clear instructions and options. Users can make selections, customize settings, and visualize progress through the wizard's interface.

The Page Wizard helps users generate different types of pages, select templates, and configure datasources and field mappings. The Function Wizard guides users in configuring logic for components, including event triggers, logic types, and data mappings.

By using wizards in eMOBIQ, users can streamline app development, reducing complexity and time required. The guided interface, along with visual examples, empowers users to create powerful and customized mobile apps with ease.
