## Detailed Sections

### eMOBIQ Home

#### Page

The Page section enables users to manage project pages by adding, duplicating, and deleting them. The selected page is displayed on the interface for easy editing. Users can utilize the Layer section to edit different components of the page.

[Related: Designing Pages](path/to/other/document.md)

#### Snippets

The Snippets section enables users to manage snippets in a project by adding, duplicating, and deleting them. The selected snippet is displayed on the interface for easy editing. Users can utilize the Layer section to edit different components of the snippet.

[Related: Using Snippets](path/to/other/document.md)

#### Layer

The Layer section allows users to manage components within a snippet or page. Users can add, duplicate, and delete components. Components are presented hierarchically, displaying parent-child relationships. Selected components are focused on the interface and editable through the properties and actions tab.

[Related: Rendering Sequence](path/to/other/document.md)

#### Screen

The Screen section enables users to manage properties and actions of selected components. Users can customize styling properties and behavior under the properties tab, and add event triggers for interactive functionality in the actions tab.

##### Properties

The Properties section enables users to manage and configure the properties of a selected component. Within this section, users have the ability to customize all styling aspects and define default behavioral properties for the component. Additionally, users can tailor the styling properties to display differently on various types of devices.

###### Styling Properties in 3 View Modes:

- **Default Mode:** Base styling properties applied to all supported devices.
- **Mobile Mode:** Styling properties specific to mobile devices.
- **Tablet Mode:** Styling properties specific to tablet devices.

##### Action

The Action section allows users to add event-driven functionality to components. Here, users configure the app logic and utilize the visual logic interface to build the component logic. By selecting the desired event trigger type and dragging actions from the action list, users can easily define the component's event logic. The section also includes an action inspector, enabling users to customize each action within the visual logic interface. This includes defining parameters to be passed for precise configuration.

###### Inspector

The Inspector allows users to configure selected actions in the visual logic interface. These configurations serve as inputs for each action, which then produces the corresponding outputs. Actions resemble traditional programming functions and their behavior is specified in the action reference.

###### Parent (or Item) - Visual Logic Interface

Description for the parent section...

###### Event - Visual Logic Interface

This selector enables users to select and configure events for the component. Multiple events with distinct behaviors can be assigned to a component. For detailed instructions on physically triggering each event, refer to the event reference documentation.

#### Themes

Description for the themes section...

#### Global

This section enables users to create and manage custom global functions within the project. Functions can be created and modified using the visual logic interface, and are readily available within the list of actions for easy integration.

##### Global Functions

In this interface, users can choose a global function from a list to modify. The selected function's implementation is displayed on the visual logic interface for easy editing.

#### Editor Interface Icons

##### Add Page (icon)

Allows user to conveniently create a page in the project.

##### Page Wizard (icon)

The Page Wizard initiates the page wizard interface for generating new pages. It offers a convenient and efficient method to create pages with template UIs tailored to specified requirements.

##### Function Wizard (icon)

The Function Wizard initiates the function wizard interface for adding event-driven logic to a selected component. It offers a convenient and efficient method to construct commonly used logic flow based on specified requirements. The generated logic for the component can be viewed in the visual logic interface.

##### Media Library (icon)

The Media Library feature enables users to upload and manage media resources for use within the project. These media files are stored alongside the compiled app

 on the server and loaded as needed. Users can browse the media library for previously uploaded files or conveniently add new ones.

[Related: Using Media](path/to/other/document.md)

##### Upload APK (icon)

Enables users to upload a pre-compiled APK file, including all Android permissions, as a new version of an existing application. A new version of the APK is generated using the project files in eMOBIQ, then merged with the uploaded APK.
