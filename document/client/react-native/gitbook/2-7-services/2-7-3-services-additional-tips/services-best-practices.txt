I want to create a best-practices manual for the services section of my no-code platform in my documentation. Here are some considerations that i have gathered. Clean up all these information and present as a best practise documentation style:


- Local table and SQLite table are both used for data management within your application, but they have some differences:
Local table: A local table is a data structure that allows you to combine and manage data easily within your application. You can edit data within a local table using relevant actions. Local tables are typically used for storing and manipulating data that is specific to your application and does not require external integration.
SQLite table: An SQLite table is a data structure that represents a specific data source and is used for integrating and interacting with SQLite databases. SQLite tables are read-only, meaning you cannot edit data directly within them. Instead, you can use functions and actions related to SQLite to query, insert, update, and delete data in the SQLite table.
In summary, local tables are used for internal data management within your application, while SQLite tables are used for integrating and interacting with external SQLite databases.

- use localStorage for small, simple data storage needs where querying and complex operations aren't required. For more complex applications with structured data, querying requirements, and a need for efficient storage, SQLite is the more powerful and flexible choice.

- More things about:
1. how to make the configurations more dynamic

2. how should data from erp or external systems be processed efficiently (minimize API calls)

3. how to handle errors and debug

4. naming conventions

5. Memory caching/storage - when to use what

6. Data Validation and Transformation
