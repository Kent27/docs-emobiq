I want to create a documentation for my no-code platform, called eMOBIQ.
This section is called conditionals.
Conditional logic blocks are constructs in eMOBIQ that control the flow of logic execution. Flow of logic execution differs based on the condition given and the callback logic for each condition.
The conditional logic block can be found in the list of actions as 'conditional'.
Conditions for which callback logic to execute are defined in the 'condition' parameter of the 'conditional' block
Refer to the callback section for more information about callback logic.
The concept of conditional logic block is the same as if-else constucts in traditional programming.

Simple example of how 'conditional' is used:
set the variable 'varA' to value 5
Using the 'conditional' logic block to check if 'varA' has the value '5' .
If true, display 'true' on console.
If false, display 'false' on console.
