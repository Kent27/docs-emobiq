# Documentation - Format

### Templates

- Contains the format of the different md files for the documentation.
    - [See - Template Function](template/template-function.md)

### Guidelines

- Embedding images, the path should be based on the root folder.
- For all outputs that can be displayed in the console will use the `console` (Cordova) or `write` (React Native) function in the example provided for those functions. For these functions, the example will be documented in a table including the expected result and explanation.
- For functions that require components to show output, the example will include the specific steps and results.
- For the folder named **gitbook** make sure it follows gitbook format, the main thing to remember is to create a **README.md** file for folders that only contain folders and don't forget to update the **SUMMARY.md**.
- Please follow the format {function-name}-{type}-{number}.png whenever you add a new image.

### Notes

- Main file video storage would be stored in this link [One Drive][One Drive Link] under the **'Videos'** folder, it's also following the naming convention similar to our folder structure.
- All video links would be redirected in this [YouTube][YouTube Link] channel.
