# Documentation - Format

### Templates

- Contains the format of the different md files for the documentation.
    - [See - Template Function](template/template-function.md)

### Guidelines

- Examples
    - For all outputs that can be displayed using the console, use the `console` (Cordova) or `write` (React Native, Server). 
    - For functions that require components to show output, the example will include the specific steps and results.
- Images
    - Embedding images, the path should be based on the root folder.
    - Please follow the format {function-name}-{type}-{number}.png whenever you add a new image.

### Notes

- Deploying to gitbook requires running the scripts, make sure to do this first.
- Main file video storage would be stored in this link [One Drive][One Drive Link] under the **'Videos'** folder, it's also following the naming convention similar to our folder structure.
- All video links would be redirected in this [YouTube][YouTube Link] channel.
